# Property Utils & Properties for Test Automation

This project is the centralization of gathering run-time properties in a testing project.  Properties can
be attained with static calls in the test code or via system or environment properties.  This project will also
house the naming of each property for an enterprise, thus keeping the naming pattern the same across the organization.
